This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with TypeScript support.

It also adds [Cypress end-to-end tests](https://www.cypress.io) written in TypeScript, see [cypress/integration/spec.ts](cypress/integration/spec.ts) using [@bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress](https://github.com/bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress)

See [cypress/tsconfig.json](cypress/tsconfig.json) for settings

To start the application, wait for the url to respond and then open Cypress run

```shell
npm run dev
```

Uses [start-server-and-test](https://github.com/bahmutov/start-server-and-test) utility
